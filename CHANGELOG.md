#### Details about changes to the mapray scene file
Rotate (`heading`, `tilt`, `roll`) and scale(`scale`) to the transform property of each entity
You can now optionally specify the properties.

The following is an example specification of the `transform` property.
It rotates 45 degrees to the right and makes the scale 10 times larger.
```
{
  "type": "generic",
  "transform": {
    "cartographic": [139.8, 36.5, 12.3],
    "heading": 45,
    "scale": [10, 10, 10]
  },
  ...
}
```

Added entity type corresponding to mapray.ModelEntity.
When using this type, specify *model* for the `type` property.

Refers to a model object registered in `model_register` by the `ref_model` property.

If there are multiple models in the referenced model object, you can use integers or names in `index`
It can be selected by specifying.

```
"model_register": {
  "model-x": {
    "link": "models/model-x.gltf",
    "offset_transform": { "heading": 180, "tilt": -90 }
  },
  ...
},

"entity_list": [
  {
    "type": "model",
    "transform": { "cartographic": [140.0, 35, 0], "heading": 180 },
    "ref_model": "model-x"
  },
  {
    "type": "model",
    "transform": { "cartographic": [140.1, 35, 0], "scale": 2.5 },
    "ref_model": "model-x",
    "index": 3
  },
  {
    "type": "model",
    "transform": { "cartographic": [140.2, 35, 0] },
    "ref_model": "model-x",
    "index": "scene-name-x"
  },
  ...
]
